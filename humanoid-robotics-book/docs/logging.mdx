## Overview

Our logging system provides structured logging capabilities for both frontend (TypeScript/JavaScript) and backend (Python) components. The system supports multiple log levels and includes contextual information with each log entry.

## Key Features

- **Multiple Log Levels**: DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR
- **Structured Logging**: Each log entry includes timestamp, level, message, and optional context
- **Contextual Information**: Include relevant data with each log entry
- **Configurable Output**: Choose between JSON or text format
- **Log History**: Retrieve logs programmatically for debugging

For more information about implementing logging in your code, see the [Logging Guide](./logging-guide.md).
